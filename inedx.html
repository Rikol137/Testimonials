        <h3> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were a current, if not more so,in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth </h3>
        <p>
         " I was EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who have had an amazing experience here. I signed for the free intro course and found it increadly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
         The next 12 weeks was the best  - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completting the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

        <h3>The team was ver supportive and kept me motivated</h3>
        <p>" I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself. "</p>

        <h3>
          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting the guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
        </h3>
        <p>
          " The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the convidence necessary to be able to get out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "

        <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommend!</h3>
        <p> " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former studen of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact ,I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
